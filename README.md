# Distraction-Free Hub

A minimal, distraction-free dashboard to gather everything you love in one place and help you focus on what matters.

## Why This Repository?

There are countless distractions around us every moment—things so attractive that we can't help but give them our attention. This often leads us to spend time on things we never intended.

This project brings together everything I want (at least) into one place with minimal distractions, so I can enjoy the things I love and focus on my daily goals. So far, this approach has been working for me!

> **Focus on your goals now, or they'll never be yours.**
